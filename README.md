# DSA_Readme
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are essential concepts in computer science that enable developers to write efficient and optimized programs.

Data Structures: Ways to organize and store data for efficient access and modification.
Algorithms: Step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems.
By mastering DSA, you can write programs that are efficient in both time complexity (speed) and space complexity (memory usage).

1. Basics of Data Structures
Arrays:

Fixed-size collection of elements of the same type.
Operations: Insertion, Deletion, Traversal, and Searching.
Example: Binary Search.
Strings:

Immutable sequence of characters in Java.
Operations: Palindrome check, String reversal, Substring matching.
Linked List:

A linear data structure with nodes linked using pointers.
Types: Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Circular Linked List.
Operations: Insertion, Deletion, Traversal.
Stacks:

Follows LIFO (Last In First Out) principle.
Applications: Undo operations, Backtracking, Parentheses Matching.
Queues:

Follows FIFO (First In First Out) principle.
Types: Circular Queue, Priority Queue, Deque.
Applications: CPU Scheduling, Task Scheduling.
Hashing:

Maps keys to values using a hash function.
Structures: HashMap, HashSet.
Applications: Caching, Storing User Data.
Trees:

Non-linear hierarchical data structure.
Types: Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree (BST), AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree.
Applications: Expression Parsing, Database Indexing.
